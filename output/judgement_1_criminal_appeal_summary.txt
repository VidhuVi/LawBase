Here's a summary of the Supreme Court judgment in *Deen Dayal Tiwari v. State of Uttar Pradesh*:

**1. Overview:** This case involves an appeal by Deen Dayal Tiwari against his conviction and death sentence for the murder of his wife and four minor daughters. The State of Uttar Pradesh is the respondent.

**2. Key Facts:** Tiwari's brother and sister-in-law heard cries from his house. Upon investigation, Tiwari was found inside his locked house with the bodies, holding a blood-stained axe. Tiwari claimed he was guarding paddy in the barn and that unknown assailants committed the murders.

**3. Legal Issues:**
    *   Whether the prosecution proved Tiwari's guilt beyond a reasonable doubt based on circumstantial evidence for the offense punishable under Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860.
    *   Whether the case falls under the "rarest of rare" category, justifying the death penalty.

**4. Reasoning (Ratio Decidendi):** The Court relied on circumstantial evidence, including: the victims found dead in Tiwari's house, Tiwari's presence with a blood-stained axe, recovery of weapons, and his failure to provide a satisfactory explanation. The chain of circumstances pointed to Tiwari's guilt. However, considering mitigating factors like the lack of prior criminal history and reports suggesting a possibility for reformation, the Court held that the death penalty was not warranted.

**5. Decision/Holding:** The Supreme Court upheld Tiwari's conviction under Section 302 IPC but commuted the death sentence to life imprisonment until his natural life's end. The appeals were partly allowed.

**6. Principles/Statutes:**

*   **Section 302 of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (Murder).**
*   **Section 106 of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (Burden of proving fact especially within knowledge).**
*   Principles regarding circumstantial evidence (complete chain excluding other hypotheses).
*   "Rarest of rare" doctrine for imposing the death penalty established in Bachan Singh v. State of Punjab and Machhi Singh v. State of Punjab, and followed in Manoj & Ors. v. State of Madhya Pradesh.
